In this challenge it is about a code quiz i created.
I Set up the HTML structure and css and javascript for the quiz interface, including a start button, timer display, question display, answer choices, and an input field for initials.
When the html loads The timer is set for 60sec.
The first question is displayed.
When a question is answered. it checks if the answer is correct by turning the option green. Red color is for wrong choices.
Same for the next question.
When the quiz is over. it display the final score. Allowing the player to save their initials and score.
